day 11 Let’s Plan What Goes in Your Database

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Platform Contributor path:

Look how Mongoose models works.


Create a new model (for example, “Note” with a title and text)



🧠 Think About:

What does your app need to remember?


What parts of your data are most important?                                                                                                                                                                                          day 12   Let’s Build a Form That Actually Saves Stuff



🎯 What You’ll Do:

Platform Contributor path:

Build a simple form (e.g., add a new note) or something if your feature has to submit the data to the database.


When the form is submitted, save the data to your database


🧠 Think About:

What makes a form easy or hard to fill out?


What should happen after someone clicks “Submit”?
day 13 Let’s Fix Little Mistakes and Make It Smoother



🎯 What You’ll Do:

Fix any bugs or errors you saw earlier


Add checks in your code so the app doesn’t crash when something is missing


Make your layout look nicer (use spacing, colors, and buttons that make sense)


🧠 Think About:

Did any part of your app confuse a friend or mentor?


What’s one tiny change that made things feel better?


day 14  Let Someone Test Your App



🎯 What You’ll Do:

Ask a friend, mentor, or peer to try your app


Watch what they do. What’s easy for them? What’s hard?


Ask: “What confused you?” or “What would you improve?”


Note: Meanwhile, Check the flow of your app (as a feature in skillmate.ai) and check how integration can actually work.



🧠 Think About:

Did someone use your app differently than you expected?


What did they like best?


day 15  Add Something Fun or Unique



🎯 What You’ll Do:

Platform Contributor path:

Add something like dark mode, emoji reactions, or animated toasts.
or

Build any small feature that you enjoy sound effects, themes, or a leaderboard.


Use a library like Shadcn UI to make it easy.


🧠 Think About:

What would make a user smile when using your app?


What do you enjoy building for fun?

day 17 Practice Git the Right Way

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Learn to use Git commit messages (small notes about what you changed).


Try making a new branch (a separate lane where you build safely).


Push your code to GitHub and open a Pull Request (like submitting homework for review).


🧠 Think About:

Why do we use Git instead of saving files as “final_final_real_last_v3”?

day 18DRY = Don’t Repeat Yourself

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Find 2 pieces of your code that look the same (like buttons, cards, forms).


Turn them into components or functions you can reuse anywhere.


🧠 Think About:

What part of your UI or logic keeps repeating?


Could you give it a name and reuse it?
