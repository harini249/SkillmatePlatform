day 1       Welcome to Your 30-Day Developer Internship

Before you can code, you need to set up your “coding playground” — a space where you can write, test, and see your work.

🎯 What You’ll Do:

If you want to build your own mini project on Skillmate:

Start a new project folder on GitHub (an online code-sharing site).

Use your favorite tools (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or Python).                                                                                day 2 Explore the Pages & How Login Works

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Create your skillmate page @ skillmate.ai

Understand How it works from onboarding to your Dashboard.

Then, Try to replicate a basic flow of skillmate,

Like, Plan a flow like this: home page → login → dashboard (a page that shows user info).

Decide what should be private (only shown if someone is logged in) and what is public.

🧠 Think About:

What should your app show when someone visits it for the first time?

What should be hidden unless someone logs in?                                                                                                      day 3 Let’s Build the Login Page

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Now you're in

Start Create a simple page that asks for a name or email.

Try next-auth to connect it to Google login.

Add a button that logs the person in.

Now you should be able to see a basic web page with a login and the details getting saved in backend MongoDB

🧠 Think About:

What should happen if someone types the wrong password?

What message should your app show when login works?

day 4 Make a Private Page Just for Logged-In Users

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Awesome! Now, you've your own page created with Single Signon along with a Backend MongoDB setup done.

Create a “dashboard” page (like a profile page).

Use next-auth to check: is the user logged in?

If not, send them back to the login screen.

🧠 Think About:

What should be on your dashboard?

How does the app know someone is “logged in”?

Try visiting the page without logging in — does it block you?

Write a short note in a file called README to explain what you're going to build.

🧠 Think About:

What do you want to build someday? A game? A website? A tool?                                                                      day 5Let’s Clean Up and Reflect

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Correct! Frontend is equally important as backend.

Tidy your layout with Tailwind (a tool that helps you style with classes).

Make sure all fields are filled in correctly.

Remove any code you didn’t end up using.

Reorganize your folders and files.

Make your code easier to read (add comments or clean names).

Note: Add Skillmate logo to your application & make it look professional

🧠 Think About:

What was your favorite task this week?

What part of your app still feels confusing?

day 6  Let Your Users Exit

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Wow! Its good to see what you've built with frontend, backend & basic login & user access functionality.

Now, lets go-ahead with Platform Contributor path: Differentiate between registered users and a visitor,

Create your own logout logic.

Clear the user data when they click “logout.”

🧠 Think About:

Why is it important to log out properly?

What should happen after someone logs out?

day 7 Show Off What You Built!

Amazing! Now you have a simple working application with you in a decent tech stack as skillmate. Let's see what you have built.

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Make a quick video (or slides) to show:

What your app does

How login works

What you learned

Share it with your peers or post online

🧠 Think About:

What was the hardest part this week?

What are you most proud of?                                                                                                                                 day 8 What’s an API and Why Does It Matter?

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Platform Contributor path:

Chose an idea that can align with skillmate existing roadmap. [Talk to our developers if you have any question. write to chat@skillmate.ai immediately]

Create a basic API using Node.js or Python Flask.

Make one GET route (where the app can get something) and one POST route (where it can send something).

If you want your API's to be integrated with existing Skillmate backend code and need to look at the routes then reach out to our developers & try implementing them as part of your routine.

or

Try running a test request using Postman (a tool that lets you test APIs easily).

🧠 Think About:

If your app is a phone, what part of it would be the API?

What does the API help you avoid doing manually?

day 9 Make Something Small, But Real

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Platform Contributor path:

Let's give life to your idea (creating a webinar, a product selling portal, community platform or anything that resonates with skillmate.ai)

picturize your idea and write down how a backend database can look alike.

Save the data into MongoDB using Mongoose (a helper for talking to the database).

🧠 Think About:

What feature would be fun to show to your friends?

What data do you want to save?

day 10 Connect Your Frontend to Your Backend

🎯 What You’ll Do:

Platform Contributor path:

Use fetch, Axios, or your tool to get data and show it.

Make your page look nice while data is loading. Add loading messages while data is being fetched.

Note: If you think, you're ahead of this. Then, start building on top of it.

🧠 Think About:

What should your app show if there’s no data?

What should it say if something goes wrong?
