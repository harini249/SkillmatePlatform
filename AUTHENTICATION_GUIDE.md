# SkillMate Authentication Guide

## How to Use the Authentication System

### For Email Signup & Login:
1. **Sign Up First**: Go to /signup and create an account with your email and password
2. **Login**: Use the same email and password you registered with on /login

### For Google Authentication:
1. Click "Continue with Google" or "Sign up with Google"
2. Enter your actual name and email when prompted
3. Your account will be created automatically with your real information

### Important Notes:
- **Real Names**: The system now uses your actual name (not "John Doe")
- **Persistent Sessions**: Once logged in, you stay logged in until you click logout
- **Dashboard Access**: Your dashboard will show YOUR name and allow you to create notes
- **Real-time Features**: Live status indicators and notifications work across tabs

### For Testing:
- Email users: Use any email/password combination (password is not validated for demo)
- Google users: Provide your real name and email for the best experience
- The system will remember your information and display it correctly

### Troubleshooting:
- If login fails, make sure you've signed up first with email
- For Google login, provide both name and email when prompted
- Your real name will appear in the dashboard after successful login
